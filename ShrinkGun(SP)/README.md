**Features**

This Mod contains a shrink gun aka "Fun Pymp Blaster" with which you can shrink and enlarge zombies and animals.

**This mod works (unfortunately) only in single player.** You can shrink yourself, but you only see that in third-person.

Since this is a fun mod, all recipes can be easily (but expensively) made with casino coins.

* **New: Fun Pymp Blaster**

* **New: Blue Fun Pymp Particle**

	Blue Pymp particles shrink the target.
	
* **New: Red Fun Pymp Particle**

	Red Pymp particles enlarge the target.
