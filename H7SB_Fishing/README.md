**Features**

H7SB Fishing is a **server-side** mod that includes a **Quick-Time** based **fishing** system.

The mod has **additional modules** that can be optionally activated.

* **New: Pond/River Sound**

	An idyllic sound effect indicates where to fish.
	
	**Works only on natural waters outside of POIs.**

* **New: Maggots and Baits**

	Maggots can be harvested from carcasses and craft into baits.
	
	Use (LMB/RMB) the bait, then quickly cast your fishing rod before it stops (60 sec) wriggling. 

* **New: Fishing Rod**

	Use a bait while standing on natural waters and then cast (LMB/RMB) the rod.
	
	If all conditions are met, you will hear a splash of water, otherwise an abort signal will sound.
	
	Look into the water and wait until you hear the water splashing again and see a fish. 
	
	Watch the fish which way it swims and drag (LMB/RMB) in the opposite direction.
	
	Repeat the process until the fish appears in front of you and you can catch it with a fishing net.
	
	Dragging in the wrong direction prolongs the process or leads to termination.
	
	**You cannot move or jump during the fishing process.**
	
	**Putting down the fishing rod before catching aborts the process.**
	
	**If you hear the sound but can't see a fish, look further up.**

* **New: Fishing Net**

	Used after a successful fishing session (LMB/RMB) to catch the fish. 
	
	LMB for small fish.		/	RMB for big fish.

* **Optional: Modules**
	
	-"zFishing(CustomFish)" A hook to add your own custom fish.
	
	-"zFishing(Quiet)" Removes the sound effect from ponds/rivers.
	
	-"zzHook(DomFarmFish)" Hook to combine domestication, farming and fishing.
