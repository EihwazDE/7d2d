**Features**

H7SB Domestication is a **server-side** mod that includes functional chickens (catching,keeping,breeding).

The mod has **special additional modules** (boar) that can be optionally activated.

* **New: Tranquillizer Dart**

	Crafted with (new) snake poision and required to capture animals. 
	
	Can be fired with any bow, but has a strong pull downward. 
	
	A short signal buff indicates when you hit your target. 

* **New: Chicken Cage**

	After the animal is tranquillized, quickly wrestle it down and use (RMB) a cage.
	
	**The hitbox is a bit inaccurate - click on/below the region around the animal's feet.**
	
	**Captured animals disappear (or can no longer be touched and despawn).**

* **New: Chicken Feed**

	Required to feed captured chickens with a (new) carrot and stick.

* **New: Chicken**

	Place the captured chicken and stand back until it appears. 
	
	Use (LMB) carrot and stick to feed the animal with food.
	
	Then wait until the chicken is ready and you can loot the nest.
	
	Repeat the process until the chicken dies or becomes pregnant.
	
	Swap the fertilized egg with carrot and stick (LMB) before the next loot.
	
	If an animal gets sick use (new) animal medicine with carrot and stick.
	
	Killed chickens (aim for nest) and dead ones can be dismantled normally.
	
	**The particle effects and sound effects reflect the animal's current status.**
	
	**If no chicken appears you can simply place the nest again** (or continue without).
	
	**If a chicken get pushed out its nest, it disappears** (but the process continues).
	
	**To interact, aim at the nest and not the animal**

* **Rework: Bird Nests & Grass Seeds**

	Bird nests disappear after looting.

	Grass Seed crafting cost has been reduced and growing time raised.
	
* **Optional: xDomestication(Boar)**

	New: Boar Cage, Boar Feed
	
	Basically, boar farming works like chicken farming.

	However, the boar cage also has to be mucked out, which requires hay.

	And instead of giving eggs, the animal gets fatter and gives more meat when slaughtered.
	
	Fully grown pigs have a chance of producing offspring.
	
	Rework: Rotten Flesh has been renamed to Organic Garbage.
	
	**The boar cage must be placed on flat surface or the animal will disappear.**
	
* **Optional: Modules**
	
	-"zzHook(DomFarmFish)" Hook to combine domestication, farming and fishing.
