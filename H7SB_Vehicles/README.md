* **Known Issues/Notes**

	The balancing (e.g. inventory) is not very good, because vanilla do not provide a smooth curve.
	
	That is why the 4x4 truck still have a oversized inventory, but I do not want to change it here,
	
	to prevent bugs/frustration when adding the mod and losing stuff. Follow me for infos about my
	
	upcoming serverside modpack, that include updates and improvements for all my modlet content.
	
	Learning and crafting will be reworked with alpha 21.
